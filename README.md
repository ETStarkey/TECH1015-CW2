**Title**: Portfolio Webpage
------------

---

**Concept**: A portfolio website to showcase a range of my creative works, from fine art, to digital media that functions over a variety of devices (widescreen, mobile, tablet, standard PC, etc.).
------------

*Utilising a tab system (using JavaScript to show and hide content divisions as needed) to catagorise different mediums of work from one-another, one tab focused on my fine art using various images to display examples of my previous artworks, another tab for my digital medium of work, another using video(s) (of suitable resolution for deployment) for my own video projects - Time (and suitable placement) permitting, I may be inclined to add a contact section for feedback or to get in contact with me.*

- Tabbed system to catagorise work mediums
- Be mindful the site still somewhat functions without becoming unusable if JavaScript is not enabled, as an example; this can be achieved (I believe) by structuring the site to work as a standard scrolling site, and then using divs+JS to hide/display the correct content as needed, this content could possibly begin to add onto the load times of the site also, which I will keep an eye on in testing as Firefox has a great tool for measuring load speed over average mobile data plan speeds AND tools for testing mobile features/adaption.
